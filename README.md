A custom Home Assistant integration that tracks your [Cargus](https://www.cargus.ro) parcels in Romania. No account is needed: you enter the AWB (the nine- or ten-digit tracking number) yourself.

> **Known gaps.** No pickup-point, missed-delivery, return or exception wording has been seen yet; a parcel that reports one logs a warning with a link to report it and may show an earlier status or `unknown`. The integration uses an unofficial route that can change, so it can stop working until an update ships.

## Features

- Track any number of Cargus parcels by tracking code — no account needed
- Per-parcel sensor with the canonical status (`registered` / `in_transit` / `out_for_delivery` / `delivered`), the carrier's own status text and a tracking deep-link
- Summary sensors: incoming parcels, next delivery, recently delivered parcels
- Read-only **Deliveries** calendar for expected delivery windows (stays empty until Cargus reports one)
- `cargus.track_parcel` / `cargus.untrack_parcel` services, so a dashboard button can add a parcel
- Events + device triggers for no-code automations (parcel registered, status changed, delivered)
- Opt-in per-parcel status history
- Manual refresh button and a diagnostic last-update sensor

## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2025.12 or newer
- A Cargus parcel and its AWB, a nine- or ten-digit number (from the
  shipping confirmation or the sender) — no account needed

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

Click the button below to open this repository in HACS, then install **Cargus**:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=ha-parcel-integrations&repository=ha-cargus&category=integration)

Or add it by hand: in HACS, choose the three-dot menu → **Custom repositories**, add `https://github.com/ha-parcel-integrations/ha-cargus` as an **Integration** and install **Cargus**.

Restart Home Assistant if HACS asks you to.

### Manual

Copy `custom_components/cargus` into your `config/custom_components/` folder and restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=cargus)

Add the integration via **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Cargus**. There is nothing to fill in: the hub is created immediately (Cargus tracking needs no account).

Then add parcels via the integration's **Configure** dialog, the [`cargus.track_parcel`](#services) service, or a [dashboard button](examples/dashboards/add_parcel_card.yaml). The AWB is on your shipping confirmation or comes from the sender. Spaces are ignored; anything that is not nine or ten digits is rejected.

## Options

Open **Configure** on the integration entry:

| Section | Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Parcels | Add / remove | — | Manage the tracked tracking codes. Changes apply immediately, no restart. |
| Delivered parcels | Filter by / amount | last 7 days | How long delivered parcels stay visible on the delivered sensor. |
| Parcel history | Include status history | off | Adds a `history` attribute per parcel with each status update. |

Polling isn't one of these settings: the integration polls on a dynamic,
status-driven schedule with nothing to configure.

## Dynamic polling

Polling isn't a setting here — the integration adjusts its own cadence to
what your tracked parcels are actually doing:

- **Quiet hours** — no polling between 00:00–06:00 local time, aside from one
  catch-up check at each end of that window (around midnight and around 6
  AM), so an overnight update is never missed.
- **Hot (every 15 minutes)** — while any tracked parcel is out for delivery
  today, starting an hour before its delivery window opens (or immediately if
  no window is known yet).
- **Normal (every 45 minutes)** — for anything else still on its way.
- **Fully paused** — once every tracked parcel has been delivered, or nothing
  is tracked at all, polling stops until you add a parcel back (adding one
  always triggers an immediate check, regardless of the pause).
- A small, fixed per-hub offset is added on top, so not every Cargus
  hub out there polls at exactly the same second.

Cargus reports no expected delivery window, so a parcel that is out for delivery is always polled on the hot cadence until it is delivered.

## Removal

Standard HA removal applies: **Settings → Devices & Services → Cargus → ⋮ → Delete**. Nothing is stored on Cargus's side.

## Sensors

| Entity | Description |
|---|---|
| `sensor.cargus_incoming_parcels` | Number of active tracked parcels, full list under the `parcels` attribute |
| `sensor.cargus_parcel_<code>` | One per tracked parcel; state is the canonical status, attributes carry the full normalised parcel |
| `sensor.cargus_next_delivery` | Stays empty: Cargus reports no expected delivery time |
| `sensor.cargus_awaiting_pickup` | Parcels waiting at a pickup point (stays empty until Cargus reports one) |
| `sensor.cargus_delivered_parcels` | Recently delivered parcels (see the retention option) |
| `sensor.cargus_last_successful_update` | Diagnostic: when Cargus was last polled successfully |

A delivered parcel moves from its per-parcel sensor to the delivered sensor automatically.

## Parcel status reference

The `status` field is the carrier-agnostic enum shared by the whole integration family:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `registered` | Cargus has created the shipment but no scan has arrived yet |
| `in_transit` | Collected from the sender and moving through Cargus warehouses |
| `out_for_delivery` | With the courier |
| `delivered` | Delivered |
| `unknown` | Not found yet, or a wording we have not mapped yet |

`at_pickup_point`, `returning` and `problem` are not reported yet: Cargus has not been seen using a wording for them.

The carrier's own human-readable text is always available as `raw_status`.

## Events

The integration fires these on the event bus (also available as device triggers on the Cargus device):

| Event | When |
|---|---|
| `cargus_parcel_registered` | A new parcel appears in the active list |
| `cargus_parcel_status_changed` | A parcel's canonical status changes (`old_status` / `new_status` in the payload), except the final hop to delivered |
| `cargus_parcel_delivered` | A parcel is delivered |

Every payload is the full normalised parcel plus the hub's `device_id`. Events are suppressed on the first refresh after start-up.

## Services

| Service | Fields | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `cargus.track_parcel` | `tracking_code` | Start tracking a parcel |
| `cargus.untrack_parcel` | `tracking_code` | Stop tracking a parcel |

## Examples

Ready-to-paste automations and dashboard snippets live in [`examples/`](examples/), including tracking a new parcel straight from a dashboard.

### Community Lovelace cards

Third-party cards that work with this integration's sensors:

- [jonisnet/hki-parcels-card](https://github.com/jonisnet/hki-parcels-card)
- [klaptafel/ha-package-tracker-card](https://github.com/klaptafel/ha-package-tracker-card)

## Debugging

```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    custom_components.cargus: debug
```

## Troubleshooting

- **A parcel shows `unknown`** — Cargus has no record of that AWB yet (it answers empty until the first scan), or the number is wrong. Very old parcels also expire and answer empty. It will pick up automatically once scanned.
- **Cargus stopped answering, or a repair says it refuses requests** — the route this integration uses can change without notice, and the integration can stop working until an update ships. Check for a new release and open an issue if there is none. Parcels keep their last known status meanwhile.
- **A status logs "Unrecognised Cargus status"** — please [open an issue](https://github.com/ha-parcel-integrations/ha-cargus/issues/new?template=unrecognised_status.yml) with the logged line so the mapping can be extended.
